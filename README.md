# Portfolio_vision
OpenCV C++ application that uses threads to do manipulate images concurrently
<br>
I read in an image and made one thread run the filter function to return a filtered version of the images.
<br>
Another thread ran the edges function to run a canny edge detection filter on the same image.
<br>
The filtered and canny edge images were then saved
